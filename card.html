                    I am eternally grateful to have had you stumble into my life. You have brought so much joy and laughter to my existence and I will forever be grateful for that.<br>
                    I love you and everything that you do. The excessive hiccups, the little tism fold of the blankets that you do, the crochet addiction. All of it.<br>
                    Since the moment I set my eyes on you outside the Glasgow trainstation I have been inlove with you. You mean so much to me and I will do everything in my power to show you that everyday.<br><br><br>
                    Happy Valentines Day, I love you.<br><br>
                    Hampus
